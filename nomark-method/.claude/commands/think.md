# First Principles Analysis

Before solving, understand the problem.

## Process

### 1. Define the Problem
- What are we actually trying to solve?
- What would success look like concretely?
- Why does this problem exist now?

### 2. Surface Assumptions
- What do we take for granted?
- What's "just how it's done"?
- What would an outsider find strange?

### 3. Question Each Assumption
For each assumption:
- Is this actually true? Evidence?
- Why do we believe this?
- What if the opposite were true?
- Is this physics/logic, or just convention?

Mark as: **Fundamental** (keep) or **Convention** (question)

### 4. Identify Fundamentals
- What constraints are actually real?
- What's left when we strip away conventions?

### 5. Rebuild From Scratch
Using ONLY fundamentals:
- If starting fresh today, what would we build?
- What becomes possible without [convention]?

### 6. Validate
- Does this solve the original problem?
- What new assumptions did we introduce?
- Is this actually implementable?

## Key Questions

| Need to... | Ask... |
|------------|--------|
| Clarify | "What do you mean by...?" |
| Challenge | "What if that weren't true?" |
| Probe | "How do we know?" |
| Shift | "How would an outsider see this?" |
| Test | "What could go wrong?" |
